WSDownloader
============

A tiny, one-liner networking library built on top of NSURLSession and AFNetworking. Therefore, it has AFNetworking as a dependency.

Okay, so what's it for?
=====
For downloading an uploading stuff to the internets from your iOS or Mac app.

Installation
=====
Use CocoaPods. Add this to your podfile:
```ruby
pod 'WSDownloader', '~> 1.0'
```

Alternatively, you can just add drag the files into your xcodeproj, but you'll need to add AFNetworking manually and you won't get easy updates.
